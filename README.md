<img width="593" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ektamistry/Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain/assets/73016922/0bcc35f0-0317-427b-a078-f31b13873624">


In my Power BI project, I successfully designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard tailored specifically for the Hospitality Domain, providing invaluable Revenue Insights. The dashboard incorporates a rich array of visualizations and interactive features, empowering stakeholders to extract actionable insights from complex data.

At the core of this dashboard, I presented essential metrics such as Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN), Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue per Available Room (RevPar), and total revenue through visually engaging charts. The line-bar graph showcasing realisation percentage and ADR booking by platform offers a dynamic view of revenue dynamics over time, facilitating data-driven decisions.

To uncover meaningful patterns, I included a table that examines RevPar, Occupancy%, ADR, and Realisation % trends based on weekdays and weekends, shedding light on occupancy and revenue fluctuations. Additionally, a line graph illustrating key matrix trends provides a comprehensive overview of performance metrics. The revenue distribution by category is visualized through a pie chart, aiding in the identification of primary revenue sources.

Furthermore, I enhanced the user experience by implementing tooltips for revenue data, providing users with instant access to detailed revenue information, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data. The dashboard's versatility is further enhanced by a robust set of filters, allowing users to explore data based on room types, city, property name, months, and weeks, tailoring the insights to their specific needs. Overall, this project showcases my expertise in data visualization, Power BI, and data analysis within the context of the Hospitality industry, highlighting my ability to deliver actionable insights from diverse datasets.
